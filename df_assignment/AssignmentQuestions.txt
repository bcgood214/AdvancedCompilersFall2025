For #2: If the values only go in one direction (a property known as monotonicity), the worklist algorithm will correctly converge to a solution regarding program variables/program state. All predecessors (forward version) or successors (backward version) can be updated based on changes to the node currently being operated on. Eventually, nodes predecessors/successors will no longer need to be updated based on a change to the node being operated. As a result, the worklist, which maintains the set of nodes that must be reevaluated, will eventually be empty.
Once the worklist is empty, the worklist algorithm has successfully reached a termination point.
