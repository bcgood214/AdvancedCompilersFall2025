- This was made in the context of the Bril repository, so you should be able to execute the commands by placing this folder in the Bril repository.

- The tests can be executed with "turnt tests/*.bril"

- I had some trouble getting certain things (such as the "Kills" function) to work in the default version, so I refactored the code with the help of GPT-5.

- There were still some issues with GPT-5's output, so the code is not a direct copy of the model's.

- I was not able to get a working implementation of AE analysis yet, but I may continue working on it.
